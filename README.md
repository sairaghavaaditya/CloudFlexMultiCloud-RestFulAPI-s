Author: Sai Raghava Aditya Madabathula
Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA, REST APIs, MySQL, Postman, IntelliJ IDEA

## Overview

CloudFlex Multi-Cloud RESTful APIs is a backend system built using Spring Boot that enables seamless management of files across Google Drive and OneDrive. The system provides RESTful endpoints to retrieve, upload, transfer, and delete files using access tokens for authentication. File metadata is stored in MySQL to allow structured access and future scalability.

This project was developed as part of my Java Developer Intern experience at Infosys Springboard.


## Features

- Retrieve files from Google Drive and OneDrive.
- Upload files to either cloud.
- Transfer files between Google Drive and OneDrive.
- Delete files from cloud storage.
- Store file metadata in MySQL for easy access and management.
- Tested and debugged using Postman.
